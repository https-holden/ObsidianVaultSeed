${G}  Done. Your vault is at:${N}
${B}  $dest${N}

${Y}  Next:${N}
  1. Open Obsidian. Click "Open folder as vault" and choose that folder.
  2. Read Home and Readme inside it (they are short).
  3. With Claude: desktop app, Code tab, open that same folder,
     and say: "Read CLAUDE.md and Me.md, then help me fill in Me.md."
     With ChatGPT: see guides/prompts-for-any-ai.md in this repo.
